# Spotify Clone 
This project is a Spotify clone built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, aiming to replicate the basic functionality of the popular music streaming platform. The main focus of this clone is to provide users with the ability to play, pause, and navigate to the previous track, mimicking the core playback features of Spotify.

## Features

- **Play, Pause, and Previous Controls:** Users can control the playback of the music tracks with the provided play, pause, and previous buttons. The play button starts the playback of the current track, while the pause button halts the playback. The previous button allows users to skip to the previous track in the playlist.

- **Responsive Design:** The clone is designed to be responsive, ensuring a seamless experience across various devices and screen sizes. Whether you're using a desktop computer, tablet, or smartphone, the interface will adapt accordingly.

- **Track Information Display:** The project displays essential track information, including the track name, artist, and album cover. This information updates dynamically as users navigate through the playlist.

- **User-Friendly Interface:** The interface is designed to be intuitive and easy to use. The controls are prominently placed, making it straightforward for users to interact with the playback functionality.
